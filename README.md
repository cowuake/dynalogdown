# Dynalogdown

If you're not among those being supplied with the link to this repository, you might probably look elsewhere.
Otherwise, enjoy this freaky tool... Nothing to be proud of! :'D

## Usage

If you came here, I expect you want to test the tool and eventually employ it in your gloomy working day.

The tool was written in Python and you can run it with the Python interpreter, yet you're not expected to have a Python environment configured on your machine.

### Run as a standalone Windows executable (for dummies)

#### Where to find the most recent Windows executable

See under __Releases__. Reach for the most recent release and download the file `dynalogdown.zip`.

#### Temporary workaround for running the executable

At present, the executable will be likely recognized as malicious. So, before extracting the archive, put it in a folder you added to the antivirus' exceptions, otherwise the executable file won't be allowed to run and will be probably deleted.

If you really came here for the tool, after all, I expect you to trust me... Since we work together :'D

### Run as a Python script

  1. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  2. Run the script with `python ./dynalogdown.py` :D

### Configuration

> Be sure you have created a copy of the `config.template.ini` file and renamed it to `config.ini`, then put it in the same folder as the executable or script (according to the way you want to run the tool).

If you came here, you should broadly understand how to configure the tool.
Otherwise (and for any other problems with the tool), please open a GitHub issue or contact me directly.
