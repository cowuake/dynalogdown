If you're not among those being supplied with the link to this repository, you might probably look elsewhere.
Otherwise, enjoy this freaky tool... Nothing to be proud of! :'D

## Usage

If you came here, I expect you want to test the tool and eventually employ it in your gloomy working day.

It was written in Python and you can run it with the Python interpreter, yet you're not expected to have a Python environment configured on your machine.

> If you came here, it's likely your current OS is Windows: every time a change is committed and pushed to this repository, after the automatic build process is completed, you can reach for the __Actions__ section, select the only workflow there listed, choose the most recent execution, and download the archive available in the __Artifacts__ section of the __Summary__.

### As a standalone Windows executable (for dummies)

At present, the executable will be likely recognized as malicious. So, before extracting the archive, put it in a folder you added to the antivirus' exceptions, otherwise the executable file won't be allowed to run and will be probably deleted.

### As a Python script

Just run the Python script :D

### Configuration

> Be sure you have created a copy of the `config.template.ini` file and renamed it to `config.ini`, then put it in the same folder as the executable or script (according to the way you want to run the tool).

If you came here, you should know how to config the tool :)
